Using Hooks & Sharing Data from Components:  Visit the https://react.dev/learn website and explain the diagram and writeup in the Using Hooks example in detail. 
	- Since the buttons have the same state, they will get updated at the same time. In the version on the left, each button stored their own state individually

Why are hooks beneficial?  
	- Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This allows us to share Hooks among many components

Can Hooks be used in class components?  
	- No, Hooks are not designed to be used on class components. Class components have their own methods for managing state

	- useContext
